    <h1>History of Cypress</h1>
    <img class="oldcypress" src="images/oldcypress.jpg">
  <p class="historyp">A general election was held April 8, 1958, whereby three City Council positions were up for
    election. As a result of the election, Walter Arrowood and Thomas Baroldi were reelected and
    Martin G. McCarney replaced Jacob Van Leeuwen, Jr., as Council Member.
    In 1959, the School District built a second school, named after Dan Mackay for his 28 years on
    the school board. The City continued to annex territory known as the Lawrence, De Potter and
    Dillon annexations. By the end of the year, a Master Plan of Arterial Highways was approved.
    In 1960, Fred D. Harber replaced Burton Wesenberg as the City's second City Manager, and a
    Building Department was established for the City. During the decade of the 60s, the City Council
    voted the dairies out of town within 10 years to make room for residents. The first major housing
    tract was approved with 600 acres sold at $6,500/acre by the Standard Development Corp.
    Zoning was changed on 400 of those acres by a 3-2 vote.
    The Los Alamitos Race Track was made a part of Cypress because of a less-tax promise the City
    made. It's still a major income producer for the City.
    In 1962, Elizabeth Dickerson School opened. John M. Toups was appointed Acting City
    Manager. At the general election, Peter D. Gorzeman, Frank P. Noe, and Mark L. Wright were
    elected to the City Council. On July 1, 1962, Darrell Essex was appointed the fourth City
    Manager, a position he would hold for 34 years.
    In 1963, Lee Damron and Clara J. King schools opened. The City Council established the City's
    Personnel Rules and Regulations. Juliet Morris and Robert C. Cawthon schools opened in 1964,
    and Frank Vessels, Sr. School opened in 1965.
    Cypress College opened in 1966, on a former dairy pasture. Margaret Landell School also
    opened that year. In 1967, Christine Swain School opened and the Cypress Civic Center, at 5275
    Orange Avenue, was dedicated. Prior to 1967, city hall, the police department and the jail were
    located in a small red house, on what is now the corner of Lindsey Lane and Walker Street. 
    In 1968, A.E. Arnold School and Steve Luther schools and the District Offices opened. Cypress
    was the first district in the county to send the sixth graders to Outdoor Camp.
    Almost a quarter of the bond proceeds were used to construct a Community Center (completed in
    1974) that serves the recreational needs of residents and organized groups from the entire
    District. The remainder of the proceeds were used to acquire 18.2 acres of new open space in
    addition to developing community park facilities, a nature park, eight neighborhood parks, and
    five local school/park areas.</p>
